# Hyperparameter_tutorial
Tutorial that is used for the WAW Machine Learning 5.

The tutorial consists of two parts:
* Tutorial_Part1 is used for an introduction to the considered regression problem. Furthermore, it gives a very short introduction to Keras.
* Tutorial_Part2 uses Talos for machine-assisted hyperparameter optimization. There is a further notebook '*_solution' that contains the solution to the exercises in this notebook.

## Installation

Before using the notebooks, you need to install  talos, keras and all other dependencies. This is done via

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
